Edit this README file so that it contains the following:

-an indication of how much time you spent on the project (you should keep track of this as you go)
James: 
    In Class time: 10
    Outside of Class time: 15
Tyler:
    In Class time: 10
    Outside of Class time: 15

-a description of what the project does
This project implements matrix multiplication using OpenMP and Cuda technology. 

-an explanation of how to compile and run the program (and what machine to run it on).  
 If your instructor doesn't have access to the machine then you should put screenshots of runs of 
 your code in the respository.
For the matrixOpenMP folder, compile the program on student2 machine and run using ./matrixMult.
For the matrixCuda folder, compile the program on cuda machine and run using ./matrixMult.


-a list of what was completed
Program 2 code was futher optimized than submitted for that program.
Matrix Multiply code for OpenMP. Created OpenMP versions of naive and transpose from program 2.
Matrix Multiply code for Cuda. Created a naive and tiled kernel.
Collected speedup data from program runs and created graphs using the following python libraries:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

-a list of what didn't get completed because of bugs in the code
Nothing because of bugs

-a list of what didn't get completed due to lack of time (ideas for future work)
Implement matrix multiply on MPI machine
Implement M x N matrices on Cuda machine
Implement blocking technique

-a link to the presentation that you gave to the class (or put the actual presentation in the repository)
Presentation is in repository
